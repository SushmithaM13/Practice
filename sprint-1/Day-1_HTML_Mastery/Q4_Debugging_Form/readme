1. <label Name="username"> → <label for="username">
- Name is not a valid attribute for <label>.
- Replaced it with for="username" to correctly associate it with the input having id="username".

2. <input type="text" id="username" name="username> → closed with " and />
- The name attribute was missing the closing double quote.
- Added the missing quote and closed the input tag properly with />.

3. <input typ="password" → type="password"
- Typo: typ should be type.
- Fixed the attribute name so the input behaves correctly as a password field.

4. <button Submit>Submit Form</buttn> → <button type="submit">Submit Form</button>
- Submit is not a valid attribute, and </buttn> is a misspelling of </button>.
- Corrected the tag to <button type="submit"> to specify it's a submit button and closed the tag properly.
